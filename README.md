# Verse Verwebt Backend

The purpose of this project is to serve as a backend for the Verse Vewebt mobile app. 

It uses REST to communicate with the frontend and has access to a database. Currently, both the backend and the database are being hosted by myself. 
This project may be accessed through elster.dev:8787, but it could also be run on any device, since it is able to access the hosted database. To switch to local hosting, one must only make changes to the frontend, the backend is usable as is.
